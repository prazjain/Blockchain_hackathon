# CorDapp created during Hackathon

This CorDapp was created during a recent hackathon, it only contains that code that was written by me during that 1 day.

Our use case was Non Disclosure Agreements: How can they be made smarter using Distribute Ledger Technology.

I worked on the Creation of NDA on blockchain, other guys were working on UI, and some others working on create/update of NDA on blockchain.
Obviously could not finish the complete usecase (as much as we had wanted to), and this is all we could do in roughly 1.5 days.

This application builds o top of the CorDapp example that is provided with the SDK. [here](http://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html).
